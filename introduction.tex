\section{Introduction}

In order to effectively evaluate changes to long-running fuzzing campaigns, we make a core distinction between two kinds of changes.  The first kind, \emph{oracle changes}, can be evaluated using what are essentially off-the-shelf mutation testing techniques, properly configured.  The second type of changes, \emph{fuzzing strategy changes}, however, require a set of complex changes to standard mutation testing practice in order to evaluate changes in a time-effective manner.
